# Plotly-and-Cufflinks 
Plotly is a library that allows you to create interactive plots that you can use in dashboards or websites (you can save them as html files or static images). 

## Installation
In order for this all to work, you'll need to install plotly and cufflinks to call plots directly off of a pandas dataframe. These libraries are not currently available through **conda** but are available through **pip**. Install the libraries at your command line/terminal using:  
```   
    pip install plotly  
    pip install cufflinks  
```    
**NOTE: Make sure you only have one installation of Python on your computer when you do this, otherwise the installation may not work.**
